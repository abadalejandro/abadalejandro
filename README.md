## Hello, I am Alejandro Abad.
After several years as a technician and network administrator and thanks to having successfully passed the Soy Henry bootcamp (800 hours), I was able to crystallize my passion for programming by becoming a fullstack developer. Because willpower and passion for a dream are stronger than time and adversity, I am the proof that when you want, you can.

My objective is to join a remote development team in which to learn and grow, participating in a project in which I can add value, face new challenges and experiences.

<br/>

### What can I contribute? ðŸŽ¯

As a Full Stack programmer I have management of React, Redux, JavaScript, Typescript, EcmaScript6, HTML5, CSS, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL and Node.js technologies, with them I can find agile and successful solutions to all problems or competent requirements. I like to work in a team, I am patient, collaborative and flexible.
